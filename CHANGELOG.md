# Changelog

All notable changes to DUX will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- **Scan caching**: Persist scan results to disk and reload on subsequent runs if the root directory hasn't changed. Cache files are stored in the system cache directory (`~/.cache/dux/` on Linux/macOS). Use `--no-cache` to force a fresh scan.
- **Incremental tree updates**: After deleting files/directories, the tree is updated in-place without requiring a rescan. Sizes and file counts propagate correctly up to the root.
- **Delete statistics**: Track and display space freed during the session. The footer shows "Freed: X.X GB (N items)" when items have been deleted.
- **Cache indicator**: Header shows "(cached)" when the tree was loaded from cache.
- **Save cache on quit**: Deletions made in dux are now persisted to cache so deleted items no longer reappear on next launch.
- **Smarter cache invalidation**: Spot-check mtimes of the 32 largest directories on cache load to detect deep filesystem changes that root mtime alone misses.

### Changed
- Tree data structure now uses tombstones for deleted nodes, allowing efficient in-place updates.
- `DiskTree` is now serializable with serde for cache persistence.
- Cache format version bumped to v3 (old caches auto-invalidate).
